# NBA_playoffs
Predicting winners in NBA playoffs is not easy because the best teams in regular season did not always win champion. I use simple algebra, proportion test and Na√Øve Bayes algorithm to get determine the winners in NBA playoffs. In other words, I calculate proportions of winning champion for top five teams in regular season and predict the winners in each series of NBA playoffs. Since there are many factors affect the NBA playoffs results, I pick winning percentage (PCT), difference of winning percentage in each series, point per game (PPG) and average point differential (DIFF) as factors to predict the winners of each series in NBA playoff.
